<h1>MixnMatch</h1>
<div>
  <p>
    This project is made using HTML,CSS,JavaScript,Bootstrap 4, jQuery UI and jQuery for the frontend or the design part and perl as the backend language. This project basically uses the .draggable() function of the jQuery UI to make the images moveable. Users can drag and drop the images to any part of the screen and when they are content with their masterpiece they are given the option of saving the design.
    The design is saved in the backend, which employs mySql database. 
  </p>
  <p>The masterpieces are saved with names and the names need not be unique (we handle that part for you). After saving the designs the user can also load existing saved designs later.</p>
  <p>This project works perfectly but due to shortage of time the developers were unable to exhaustively test the web application, so if you find any error do raise a flag or make the changes and we will push it to the main repo.</p>
